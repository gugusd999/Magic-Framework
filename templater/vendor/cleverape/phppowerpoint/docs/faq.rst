Frequently asked questions
==========================

Is this the same with PHPPowerPoint that I found in CodePlex?
-------------------------------------------------------

No. This one is much better with tons of new features that you can’t
find in PHPPowerPoint 0.1. The development in CodePlex is halted and
switched to GitHub to allow more participation from the crowd. The more
the merrier, right?

I’ve been running PHPPowerPoint from CodePlex flawlessly, but I can’t use the latest PHPPowerPoint from GitHub. Why?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PHPPowerPoint requires PHP 5.3+ since 0.2, while PHPPowerPoint 0.1 from CodePlex
can run with PHP 5.2. There’s a lot of new features that we can get from
PHP 5.3 and it’s been around since 2014! You should upgrade your PHP
version to use PHPPowerPoint 0.2+.
